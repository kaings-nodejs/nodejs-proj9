/* TESTING DUMMY FILE WITH DUMMY HASH */
/* 
when build, all the files will be bundled, all static files (css, js?) will be hashed
by using some tool (such as GULP, WEBPACK, etc.) and embeded/inserted in the index.html
since index.html is 'no-cache', it will detect everytime these static files (css,etc) have change
which will automatically update the index.html with the latest static files content eventhough 
the static files are set with 'Cache-Control: max-age=100000000' (for example)
 */

/* 
you can sort of emulate this by changing 'main.css' with this 'main.t35t1n6.css' (the dummy hashed static file).
to emulate the static files build with hash
